# Science of Science
Welcome to the Science of Science repository! This repository aims to explore the fascinating field of studying science itself, known as the Science of Science. I delve into the dynamics, patterns, and processes that shape the scientific enterprise, uncovering insights and advancing our understanding of how science works.

## Description

The Science of Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines techniques from data science, network analysis, bibliometrics, social science, and more to investigate various aspects of scientific research. It involves analyzing large-scale scientific datasets, exploring collaborations and knowledge diffusion, identifying influential researchers and institutions, understanding the impact of funding and policies, and examining the emergence and evolution of scientific disciplines.

This repository serves as a hub for sharing resources, research findings, and tools related to the Science of Science. Whether you are a researcher, practitioner, or simply interested in the inner workings of science, we invite you to join our community and contribute to the collective knowledge in this exciting field.
